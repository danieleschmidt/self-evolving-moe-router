# Project Charter: Self-Evolving MoE-Router

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: Self-Evolving MoE-Router  
**Project Type**: Open Source Research Framework  
**Start Date**: January 2025  
**Expected Duration**: 18 months to v1.0  
**Status**: Active Development  

## Problem Statement

Current Mixture of Experts (MoE) models rely on manually designed routing strategies that are:
- **Static and inflexible**: Fixed routing patterns cannot adapt to changing workloads or hardware constraints
- **Suboptimal**: Hand-crafted routing rarely achieves optimal performance across diverse tasks and hardware
- **Hardware-agnostic**: No consideration for deployment target capabilities (edge, mobile, datacenter)
- **One-size-fits-all**: Same routing strategy applied regardless of task complexity or resource constraints

This results in:
- **Poor resource utilization**: Experts may be underutilized or overloaded
- **Deployment inefficiency**: Models cannot adapt to hardware constraints
- **Missed optimization opportunities**: Potential for better accuracy-efficiency trade-offs unexplored
- **High operational costs**: Inefficient resource usage in production deployments

## Solution Vision

Develop an evolutionary framework that automatically discovers optimal sparse routing topologies for MoE models through:

1. **Evolutionary Optimization**: Use genetic algorithms to evolve routing patterns that maximize task performance while minimizing computational cost
2. **Hardware-Aware Evolution**: Optimize routing topologies for specific deployment targets (edge, mobile, datacenter)
3. **Online Adaptation**: Enable continuous evolution of routing patterns during deployment based on real-world performance
4. **Slimmable Architecture**: Create experts that can dynamically adjust their capacity based on available resources
