# GitHub Actions Workflow Documentation

This directory contains documentation for GitHub Actions workflows that should be implemented for the project.

**Note**: Actual workflow YAML files must be created manually in `.github/workflows/` directory due to security restrictions.

## Required Workflows

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline (`ci.yml`)

**Purpose**: Continuous integration and testing

**Triggers**:
- Push to main branch
- Pull requests to main
- Manual dispatch

**Jobs**:
```yaml
# Example structure - implement manually
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9, "3.10", "3.11"]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -e ".[dev]"
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          pytest --cov=self_evolving_moe --cov-report=xml
      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```

### 2. Security Scanning (`security.yml`)

**Purpose**: Automated security vulnerability detection

**Features**:
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Secret detection
- SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- Supply chain security

### 3. Code Quality (`quality.yml`)

**Purpose**: Enforce code quality standards

**Features**:
- Linting with flake8
- Type checking with mypy
- Code formatting with black
- Import sorting with isort

### 4. Documentation (`docs.yml`)

**Purpose**: Build and deploy documentation

**Features**:
- Sphinx documentation generation
- API documentation auto-generation
- GitHub Pages deployment

### 5. Release (`release.yml`)

**Purpose**: Automated package publishing

**Features**:
- PyPI package publishing
- GitHub release creation
- Changelog generation
- Version tagging

## Implementation Instructions

1. Create `.github/workflows/` directory in repository root
2. Copy the example workflow structures above
3. Customize for specific project needs
4. Set up required secrets in GitHub repository settings:
   - `PYPI_API_TOKEN` for package publishing
   - `CODECOV_TOKEN` for coverage reporting

## Workflow Dependencies

### Required GitHub Secrets
- `PYPI_API_TOKEN`: For publishing to PyPI
- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: For coverage reporting

### Required Permissions
- Contents: read/write (for releases)
- Pull requests: write (for comments)
- Checks: write (for status updates)

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Review workflow runs weekly
- Update action versions quarterly
- Monitor security advisories
- Optimize build times continuously

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Dependency conflicts**: Use pip-tools for dependency resolution
2. **Test timeouts**: Increase timeout values for ML workloads
3. **Memory issues**: Use GitHub's larger runners for heavy computations
4. **Flaky tests**: Implement retry mechanisms

### Performance Optimization
- Cache dependencies between runs
- Use matrix strategies for parallel execution
- Minimize Docker layer rebuilds
- Implement incremental testing
