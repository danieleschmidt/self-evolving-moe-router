# Self-Evolving MoE-Router Roadmap

## Project Vision

Transform Mixture of Experts (MoE) models from static, manually-designed architectures into adaptive, self-optimizing systems that automatically discover optimal routing patterns through evolutionary algorithms. Our goal is to make MoE models more efficient, hardware-aware, and deployable across diverse computational environments.
